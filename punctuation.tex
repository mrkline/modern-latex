\chapter{Punctuation}
\label{punctuation}

You would much rather encounter a panda that eats
shoots and leaves than one that eats, shoots,
and leaves.\punckern\endnote{Lynne Truss,
\textit{Eats, Shoots \& Leaves} (New York, 2003)}
Punctuation is a vital part of writing,
and there's more to it than your keyboard suggests.

\section{Quotation marks}

\LaTeX{} doesn't automatically convert \texttt{"}straight\texttt{"} quotes
into correctly-facing ``curly'' ones:
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
"This isn't right."
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
will get you
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
"This isn't right."
\end{leftfigure}
Instead, use \texttt{`} for opening quotes and \texttt{'} for closing
quotes.\punckern\footnote{If your keyboard layout happens to have keys for
``curly'' quotes (\,\texttt{“}\,\texttt{”}\,), feel free to use those instead!
Also, don't use \texttt{"} for closing double quotes.
Not only does \texttt{``example"} look a bit unbalanced,
but \texttt{"} is used as a formatting command when typesetting certain
languages, like German. (See \chapref{i18n} for more on international
typesetting.)}
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.''
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
quotes a former \acronym{us} president as,
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.''
\end{leftfigure}

\section{Hyphens and dashes}

Though they look similar,
hyphens (\,-\,), en dashes (\,--\,),
em dashes (\,---\,), and minus signs (\,$-$\,)
serve different purposes.
\begin{description}
\item[Hyphens] have a few applications:\endnote{Matthew Butterick,
    ``Hyphens and dashes''\quotekern,
    \textit{Practical Typography},
    \https{practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html}}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item They allow a word to be split between the end of one line and the
        start of the next.
        \LaTeX{} usually handles this automatically.
    \item Some compound words use hyphens, like \emph{long-range}
        and \emph{field-effect}.
    \item They are used in phrasal adjectives.
        If I ask for ``five dollar bills''\punckern,
        do I want five \$1 bills, or several \$5 bills?
        It's clearer that I mean the latter when typeset as
        \emph{five-dollar bills}.
    \end{itemize}
    Unsurprisingly, they are produced with the hyphen key (\,\texttt{-}\,).

\item[En dashes] are for ranges such as ``pages 4--12''\quotekern,
    and connected word terms, like the \mbox{``US--Canada} border''\quotekern.
    They are set with two adjacent hyphens (\,\texttt{--}\,).

\item[Em dashes] can be used to separate clauses of a sentence.
    Other punctuation---like parenthesis or commas---play a similar
    role.
    They are set with three hyphens (\,\texttt{---}\,).

\item[Minus signs] are used for negative quantities and
    mathematical expressions.
    They are similar in length to an en dash,
    but sit at a different height.
    Minus signs are set with \verb|\textminus|, or with the hyphen key when in
    a math environment (see \chapref{math}).
\end{description}

\section{Ellipses}

A set of three dots used to indicate a pause or omission is called an
\introduce{ellipsis}.
It is set with \verb|\dots|.
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
I'm\dots{} not sure.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
becomes
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
I'm\dots{} not sure.
\end{leftfigure}

\section{Spacing}

As we discovered in \chapref{hello},
\LaTeX{} inserts more space between periods and whatever
follows them---presumably the start of the next sentence.
This isn't always what we want!
Consider honorifics like Mr.\ and Ms., for example.
In situations like these, we also need to prevent \LaTeX{} from starting a
new line after the period.
This calls for a \introduce{non-breaking space}, which we set with a tilde.
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
Please call Ms.~Shrdlu.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
produces proper spacing:
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
Please call Ms.~Shrdlu.
\end{leftfigure}

In other occasions, such as when we abbreviate units of
measurement,\punckern\footnote{There are also dedicated packages for doing so,
like \texttt{siunitx}.}
we want thinner spaces than our usual inter-word ones.
For these, we use \verb|\,|\,:
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
Launch in 2\,h 10\,m.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
announces
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
Launch in 2\,h 10\,m.
\end{leftfigure}

\section{What next?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add hyphenations for uncommon words using \verb|\hyphenate|
    or \verb|\-|\,.\punckern\footnote{\LaTeX{} usually does a good
    job of automatically hyphenating words, based on a dictionary of patterns
    stored for each language. You should rarely need these tools.}
\item Learn other commands for spacing, such as \verb|\:|, \verb|\;|,
    \verb|\enspace|, and \verb|\quad|.
\item Use the \texttt{csquotes} package's \verb|\enquote| to simplify
    nested quotations, e.g., \\
    \enquote{She exclaimed, \enquote{I can't believe it!}}
\item Discover the typographical origins of terms like \introduce{en},
    \introduce{em}, and \introduce{quad}.
\item Familiarize yourself with the difference between \texttt{/} and
    \verb|\slash|.
\end{itemize}
